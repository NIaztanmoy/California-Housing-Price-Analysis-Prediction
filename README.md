Dataset Overview: California Housing
This dataset contains information about various metrics related to California's housing market, with a primary focus on predicting and classifying house prices. Each entry represents a small geographical area, and the columns include features like location (latitude/longitude), house age, number of rooms, population, median income, and ocean proximity. The main goal is to use these features to predict the median house value.

Final Project Report
This project focused on analyzing the California Housing dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models. The primary steps involved exploring the data, handling missing values, and preparing the features for modeling.

Two main models were developed:

A Linear Regression model was trained to predict the continuous median house value. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like R-squared.

A Logistic Regression model was built to classify houses as "expensive" or "not expensive" based on whether their value was above a certain threshold. The model achieved an accuracy of 84%, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify the houses.

The project successfully applied both regression and classification techniques to a real-world dataset, providing key insights into the factors influencing housing prices in California.
